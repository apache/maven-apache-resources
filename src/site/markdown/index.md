Apache Resource Bundles provides a set of resources to help ASF projects build Java resources compliant with ASF rules:

- [JAR Resource Bundle](./jar/) to generate `META-INF/DEPENDENCIES`, `META-INF/LICENSE`, `META-INF/NOTICE`

- [TXT JAR Resource Bundle](./jar-txt/) to generate `META-INF/DEPENDENCIES.txt`, `META-INF/LICENSE.txt`, `META-INF/NOTICE.txt`

- [Incubator Disclaimer Resource Bundle](./incubator-disclaimer/) to generate `META-INF/DISCLAIMER`

- [Source Release Assembly Descriptor](./source-release/) to create `-source-release` archives that contain the fully buildable project directory source structure

- [License Header Resource Bundle](./license-header/)
